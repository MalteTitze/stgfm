# stgfm: symplectic tracking based on generating functions applied to multipoles
# ---
# 
# Fortran implementation of formulas developed at Helmholtz-Zentrum
# Berlin by M. Titze in cooperation with J. Bahrdt and G. Wuestefeld.
# 
# Warning! The code is not optimized for numeric applications or meant as a starting point for
# higher-order implementations (because it will get very clumsy this way). It should only test the principles.
# Especially the Fourier decomposition for the higher-order
# generating functions and the cylinder coordinates for small offsets
# produce systematic errors. The basic principles however do not require such restrictions and do not have
# such errors.
# 
# contact the authors for further details.
