# Warning! The code is not optimized for numeric applications or meant as a starting point for
# higher-order implementations (because it will get very clumsy this way). It should only test the principles.

# produce systematic errors. The basic principles however do not require such restrictions and do not have
# such errors.

STGFM
=====

Fortran implementation of formulas for symplectic tracking based on generating
functions applied to multipoles, developed at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin 
by Malte Titze, Johannes Bahrdt and Godehard Wuestefeld.

Documentation
-------------
The code is not optimized for numeric applications or meant as a starting point for
higher-order implementations (because it will get very clumsy this way).
It should only test the principles. Especially the Fourier decomposition for the higher-order
generating functions and the cylinder coordinates for small offsets
produce systematic errors. The basic principles however do not require such restrictions and do not have
such errors.  Further documentation has to be done, contact the authors in case of problems.

Pre-requisites
--------------
Working fortran compiler.
